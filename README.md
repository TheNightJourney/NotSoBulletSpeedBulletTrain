# Not So Bullet Speed Bullet Train

Hello hello hello! This is the Not So Bullet Speed Bullet Train. Basically put, it's a simple system made using the Finite State Machine theory,
and implementing further steps such as the Truth Table, State Table, Karnaugh Maps and its Boolean Equations. Enjoy!

To run the file, simply use the 'make' function, as everything is compacted into the Makefile. 

Regarding the details, everything can be found inside the "Details" folder, where all the prerequisites were written, drawn, and uploaded.

### Instructions
While I recommend playing around and figuring what goes where, the directions are within the ASCII Directions.txt file, so for verification you may use that.
